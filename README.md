# AspNetCore-Advanced-Course
Small e-commerce developed during the [Aspnet Core Advanced course](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-aspnet-core-3-advanced) from Udemy

For demo and testing pourposes, this app is hosted at Azure (https://upliftewer.azurewebsites.net)

#Too slow at first load? 
This is due to Azure hosting options i used to save money. The app is hosted at a free plan and the database is a serverless Sql Server which sleeps after 1 hour of inactivity, so the first request can takes 1 minute or more, the subsequent requests should be fast.

_Original code from the course is hosted at (https://github.com/bhrugen/Uplift)_
